## About The Project

<div align="center">

There is many counters. However I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. Although it's called Boring in reality it's enhanced one. Main goal was to create Counter App that provides list of counters where each one could be increment independently; from list view. I find that useful while doing my Diablo Uber Uniques grind since I'm big fan of statistics and like to keep track of things.

Along the way few other features were introduced to make whole App more usable. 

Please refer to [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install Flutter & Flutter FVM for best experience
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LosDanieloss/boring_counter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to main project directory
3. Get dependencies
   ```sh
   $ flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the App. For more information about that please see [Flavors](#flavors).
   ```sh
   $ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
   ```


### Flavors

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Boring Counter works on iOS, Android and Web._


### Running Tests

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

To generate new coverage badge you can use [flutter_coverage_badge](https://github.com/amondnet/flutter_coverage_badge)

```sh
$ flutter pub run flutter_coverage_badge
```


### Working with Translations

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].
